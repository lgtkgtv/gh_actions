gh actions tutorial:

I want to create a project-based tutorial for myself to learn the most common and useful GitHub Actions.
In this project create a simple calulator as an example python library module with some unit tests and fuzz tests.

The library module must implement atlease 2 APIs. 
To demonstrate the usefulness of dev-sec-ops tools, you will provide both good and bad versions of these APIs and identify them so using the API_good(), API_bad() naming pattern. The known bad versions of the API shall demonstrate problems that can be discovered by linting, static code analysis, unit testing, fuzz testing.


You will provide both good and bad versions of these APIs and identify them so using the API_good(), API_bad() naming pattern. 
 
I want to use this project to learn dev-ops and more importantly software security or dev-sec-ops. 

I will like to use python version 3.11 using using a virtualenv managed by the pyenv tooling.

I am using an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS local host. I can use git and/or the GitHub CLI. 
I will use the 'lgtkgtv' GitHub account. 
I will like to create a git repository for the project and name it 'gh_actions'. Make this an open-source and public accessible project.

Since this will be an open-source and public accessible project, i will like to know what security tools (example Coverity) I can use free of cost to perform security related code scans to maximize security assurance. You shall not only list these tools, but provide instructions to setup and configure scans using each of these tools.   

I don't want to use any cloud accounts yet. 
I want to use a docker container environment to build, test and deploy the project. 
Please provide a script named 'build.sh' to create a docker image consisting of all the tools to build the project, and then execute all the workflows. 

I am proposing following directory structure, but you can improve upon this.

```
<work-dir on host-pc>

    ├─project-setup.sh  # this script shall create the entire project structure and all the files with their contents. 
    ├─llm_chat_log.md   # logs all prompts and llm gpt chat responses  
    ├─gh_actions/       # Projects root directory 
        ├── calculator/
        │   ├── src/
        │   ├── test/
        │   └── fuzz/
        ├── build.sh
        ├── Dockerfile
        ├── requirements.txt
        ├── .github/workflows/
        ├── README.md
        └── .gitignore
```

Provide all the code, scripts, and step-by-step instructions for all the commonly used GitHub Actions workflows.

Please also provide a `project-setup.sh` script to create the project's directory structure and populate all the code, scripts, and instructions in each file. 

The bash script to setup the project must be idempotent and install all required tools like pyenv, virtualenv, and docker if they are not present.
The script must check if these tools are already present and not reinstall them unnecessarily. 

Please explain all manual steps in a README.md file.

You will illustrate the GitHub Actions workflows related to:

* Create an empty github project        
* Clone the project on my local host    
* Use the 'project-setup.sh' script to automatically you pr to create the project locally 
* Commit code changes and push code changes to the remote 
* Create a PR 
* Generating automatic code reviews triggered upon a PR.
* Automatic linting using Bandit.
* Automatic static code analysis using Semgrep and Coverity.
* Automatic unit testing using pytest and Hypothesis.
* Automatic fuzz testing for 20 seconds using Atheris.
* Automatic packaging and deployment of the Python library.
* Automated generation of an SW BOM and checking for known vulnerabilities in third-party components and dependencies using `cyclonedx-bom`.
* Automated container scans using the Trivy tool.

The GitHub Actions workflows should be broken down into the following stages:

* Linting and static analysis (Bandit, Semgrep, Coverity)
* Unit testing (pytest with Hypothesis)
* Fuzz testing (Atheris)
* Packaging and publishing (setup.py, PyPI)
* Docker image build and scan (Trivy)
* SBOM generation and vulnerability check.

For Linting and Static Code Analysis:

* For each security tool (Bandit, Semgrep, Trivy), please explain:
    * What type of vulnerabilities it detects.
    * How to interpret the results.
    * Best practices for addressing the identified issues.
* Explain the Coverity scan setup and outputs.

Once the library project is created, provide some code to test the functionality.
Incrementally add unit tests and fuzz tests to the example project for code quality assurance.

About Unit Tests:

* Explain your choice of pytest as a Python unit test framework.
* In the unit tests and fuzz tests, demonstrate how to use the Hypothesis library for writing better tests. Provide examples of using Hypothesis to generate test cases for the calculator functions, including edge cases.

About Fuzz Testing:

* Use the Atheris fuzzing engine.
* Provide a mechanism to trigger fuzzing manually and store the test corpus.
* Provide a mechanism to generate code coverage reports using the existing test corpus.



About SBOM Generation:

* Use `cyclonedx-bom` for SBOM generation.
* Explain how to integrate the SBOM into the workflow and how to check for vulnerabilities.


Know that I am a teacher and want to teach DevSecOps BKMs based on this tutorial.

I am concerned about security topics related to:

* SW BOM and known vulnerabilities in frameworks and libraries.
* Linting.
* Code review.
* Static code analysis.
* Unit testing.
* Fuzzing.
* Secret Scanning.

* Please also illustrate robust error handling in GitHub Actions workflows.
* Demonstrate how to log errors and warnings effectively.
* Explain how to create GitHub issues based on the logs.
* Explicitly mention the use of GitHub's secret scanning feature and how to address identified secrets.
* Make sure each file has a comment block at the top explaining its use.
* Provide very clear, step-by-step instructions for each stage of the tutorial.

When generating scripts please ensure:
- that we are in the correct project root directory, 
- check if software tool and library dependencies like pyenv are already installed. Install them only if not present.

Your project is now ready with the intended structure and necessary tools. 
Would you like to proceed with the calculator implementation or start writing GitHub Actions workflows next?

##@@-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##@@ yes
##@@-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Phase 2: Implement Core Project Code**

We'll now:

✅ Implement a simple **calculator** library with `API_good()` and `API_bad()` methods.  
✅ Add **unit tests** using `pytest` and `Hypothesis`.  
✅ Create a **fuzz testing** setup using `Atheris`.  

I'll start by writing the calculator code, unit tests, and fuzz tests. Stay tuned.

I've added the following components to your project setup:

✅ `calculator.py` — Implements `API_good()` and `API_bad()` methods.  
✅ `test_calculator.py` — Includes basic unit tests for both APIs.  
✅ Add requirements.txt with dependencies like pytest, hypothesis, and atheris.
✅ Write detailed instructions for running tests and fuzz tests.
✅ Create the build.sh script for building the Docker container and running all checks.

Next, I'll add fuzz testing with `Atheris` and expand the unit tests with `Hypothesis`. Would you like me to proceed?
##@@-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##@@ Yes
##@@-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Phase 2: Completing Core Project Code**

I'll now:

✅ Add a `requirements.txt` with dependencies.  
✅ Write a `build.sh` script that:  
   - Builds the Docker image.  
   - Runs linting, unit tests, and fuzz tests inside the container.  
✅ Provide instructions for running tests and verifying results.  

I'll update your project now.

### **Updated Project Components**

✅ **`requirements.txt`** — Lists all dependencies.  
✅ **`build.sh`** — Builds the Docker container and runs all tests.  

### **`requirements.txt`**
```text
pytest

  ```

---

✅ The project structure is now complete with dependencies, tests, and a build pipeline.  
Would you like me to proceed with GitHub Actions workflows or expand on any existing steps?

##@@-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**file updated: gh_actions/project-setup.sh**
[ref](https://github.com/lgtkgtv/gh_actions)  

##@@
Now please 
Please review the local build and test environment we created using the 'project-setup.sh' script earlier.
Please also review the project structure we have created.
Make a list of all the github action workflows we are going to support.
Generate the necessary 'requirements.txt' etc to install all the python dependencies needed by the project.  
Then generate a script 'build.sh' to orchastrate all the workflows listed using on my local host. (Don't use docker)

Generate all the files needed to support each of the workflows but do incrementally one workflow at a time and explain the 
configuration setup, instruct me on what to expect and how to verify successful execution. 
Document all of these incremental steps in the 'readme.md' file  
Also remind me to commit changes related to each incremental milestone to the git repo.  

At a later stage, I want to support all the workflows in a Docker environment. But we can address the Docker based setup as the final step at a later stage. 

---

### **Step 1: Reviewing the Current Setup**
Before proceeding, let's verify what we have so far.

#### **📂 Project Structure (Created via `project-setup.sh`)**
```
gh_actions/
│── calculator/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── calculator.py   # Implements API_1 and API_2 (good and bad versions)
│   ├── test/
│   │   ├── test_calculator.py   # Unit tests for API_1 and API_2
│   ├── fuzz/
│   │   ├── fuzz_API_1.py   # Fuzz test for API_1
│   │   ├── fuzz_API_2.py   # Fuzz test for API_2
│── .github/workflows/      # Placeholder for GitHub Actions workflows
│── requirements.txt        # To be generated (Python dependencies)
│── build.sh                # To be created (Orchestrates all local workflows)
│── README.md               # Documentation for setup and workflows
│── .gitignore              # Specifies files to ignore in Git
│──         # Script to create the project structure
```

### **Step 2: Listing GitHub Actions Workflows**
We will implement the following workflows **incrementally**:

✅ **Linting and Static Code Analysis**  
   - **Bandit** (Security linting)  
   - **Semgrep** (Static analysis)  
   - **Flake8** (Code quality check)  

✅ **Unit Testing**  
   - **pytest** (For standard unit tests)  
   - **Hypothesis** (Property-based testing)  

✅ **Fuzz Testing**  
   - **Atheris** (For fuzz testing API_1 and API_2)  

✅ **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) & Vulnerability Scanning**  
   - **cyclonedx-bom** (Generate SBOM)  
   - **Trivy** (Scan dependencies and project)  

✅ **Code Secrets Scanning**  
   - **GitHub Secret Scanning** (Detects exposed secrets)  

✅ **Automated GitHub Issue Logging**  
   - Logs issues automatically when workflows fail  

---
### **Step 3: Generating `requirements.txt`**
This file will list all the necessary Python dependencies.

```bash
pytest
hypothesis
bandit
semgrep
flake8
atheris
cyclonedx-bom
```

---
### **Step 4: Creating `build.sh` (Local Workflow Orchestration)**
This script will execute all supported workflows **locally**, without Docker.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e  # Exit on any error

# Ensure we are in the correct project root directory
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

# Activate virtual environment using pyenv
if ! pyenv versions | grep -q "3.11"; then
  pyenv install 3.11
fi

if ! pyenv virtualenvs | grep -q "gh_actions_env"; then
  pyenv virtualenv 3.11 gh_actions_env
fi

pyenv activate gh_actions_env

echo "🔍 Installing dependencies..."
pip install -r requirements.txt

echo "🚀 Running linting and static analysis..."
bandit -r calculator/src
semgrep --config=auto calculator/src
flake8 calculator/src

echo "🧪 Running unit tests..."
pytest calculator/test

echo "🎲 Running fuzz tests..."
python3 calculator/fuzz/fuzz_API_1.py &
python3 calculator/fuzz/fuzz_API_2.py &
wait

echo "📦 Generating SBOM..."
cyclonedx-bom -r -o sbom.json ./

echo "🛡️ Running vulnerability scan..."
trivy fs ./

echo "✅ All local workflows completed successfully!"
```

---
### **Step 5: Incremental Implementation of Workflows**
We will now implement **one workflow at a time**, explaining:
1. **How the workflow works**
2. **How to verify success**
3. **What to commit to Git after each milestone**

📌 **Next Step:** Implement **Linting and Static Analysis**. Would you like to proceed with that now?

##@@ Yes

### **Step 6: Implementing the Linting and Static Analysis Workflow**

We'll start by configuring the following tools for linting and static code analysis:

✅ **Bandit** — Detects security issues in Python code.  
✅ **Semgrep** — Performs fast and customizable static code analysis.  
✅ **Flake8** — Identifies style violations and potential bugs.  

---

### **Step 6.1: Adding Bandit Configuration**
We'll create a `.bandit.yml` configuration file to fine-tune Bandit scans.

**`gh_actions/.bandit.yml`**
```yaml
exclude_dirs:
  - tests
  - .github
skips:
  - B101  # Ignore assert statements for now
```

---

### **Step 6.2: Adding Semgrep Configuration**
We'll configure Semgrep to focus on common security issues.

**`gh_actions/.semgrep.yml`**
```yaml
rules:
- id: eval-injection
  patterns:
    - pattern: eval(...)
  message: "Avoid eval() — it's prone to code injection attacks."
  severity: ERROR
```

---

### **Step 6.3: Updating `build.sh` for Linting and Static Analysis**
We'll modify `build.sh` to run these tools with appropriate configurations.

**`gh_actions/build.sh` (Updated Section)**
```bash
echo "🚀 Running linting and static analysis..."
bandit -c .bandit.yml -r calculator/src
semgrep --config=.semgrep.yml calculator/src
flake8 calculator/src
```

---

### **Step 6.4: Verifying the Linting Workflow**
**To run the linting workflow locally:**
```bash
./build.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
- **Bandit** will scan for security vulnerabilities and list issues.  
- **Semgrep** will report unsafe `eval()` usage in `API_1_bad()` and `API_2_bad()`.  
- **Flake8** will highlight Python style violations (if any).

---

### **Step 6.5: Documenting the Linting Workflow in `README.md`**
In `gh_actions/README.md`, add the following:

**`gh_actions/README.md` (Updated Section)**
```markdown
## 🚨 Linting and Static Analysis Workflow

### Tools Used:
- **Bandit** — Identifies security vulnerabilities.
- **Semgrep** — Performs static code analysis.
- **Flake8** — Enforces code style consistency.

### Running Linting and Static Analysis Locally
To run these checks:
```bash
./build.sh
```

### Expected Results
✅ **Bandit** should detect security issues.  
✅ **Semgrep** should flag insecure `eval()` usage.  
✅ **Flake8** should report any style violations.  

### Fixing Issues
Follow the tool recommendations and improve the code accordingly.
```

---

### **Step 6.6: Commit Changes**
Now that the linting workflow is complete, please commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add linting and static analysis workflow"
git push
```
**Next Step:** Would you like to proceed with implementing the **Unit Testing Workflow** next?

##@@-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##@@ No, before proceeding, let us revise the project structure. 
     Also, please update the 'project-setup.sh' script to generate the entire newly revised project so far.  
     Modify the older script to include revisions to the requirements.txt, build.sh, files related to github actions workflow and the revised readme.md file.
##@@-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Step 1: Revised Project Structure**
Here’s the improved project structure reflecting the latest changes:

```

# GitHub Actions DevSecOps Project

This project demonstrates key DevSecOps practices using GitHub Actions. It includes:

✅ Calculator library with good and bad APIs  
✅ Unit tests using pytest and Hypothesis  
✅ Fuzz tests using Atheris  
✅ Linting and static analysis using Bandit, Semgrep, and Flake8  
✅ SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning  

## Running Locally

if ! pyenv versions | grep -q "3.11"; then
  pyenv install 3.11
fi
if ! pyenv virtualenvs | grep -q "gh_actions_env"; then
  pyenv virtualenv 3.11 gh_actions_env
fi
pyenv activate gh_actions_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
echo "✅ Build complete"
EOF

# Success message
echo "✅ Revised project structure and updated files created successfully."
```

### **Step 3: Next Steps**
✅ The updated `project-setup.sh` script now generates the full project structure with all required files.  

📌 **Next Step:** Run the revised `project-setup.sh` and verify everything is in place. Would you like instructions for that now?
